`realdebrid-CLI`_
=================

    Use Read-Debrid from your command line !

``rdcli`` is a tool allowing you to use Real-Debrid from your command
line. It’s written in `Python 2.7`_ because Python comes pre-installed
on most distribution nowadays, limiting the amount of software
dependency.

Installation
------------

Using ``pip`` (preferred method)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest version of ``rdcli`` on your computer, open a
terminal and enter the following line:

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install rdcli

To update ``rdcli``, run :

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install rdcli -U

Alternative method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don’t have/want ``pip`` installed on your computer, you can
manually install ``rdcli`` with the following commands (cloning the repo
and launching the ``setup.py``)

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/MrMitch/realdebrid-CLI.git
    cd realdebrid-CLI
    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

In the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli [OPTIONS] LINK

``OPTIONS`` can be:

::

    -h    Help. Display this help.
    -i    Init. Force rdcli to ask for your login and password.
          Useful if you made a typo or if you changed your login information since you first used rdcli.
    -l    List. Write a list of the successfully unrestricted links on STDOUT, without downloading.
          -t and -q options have no effect if -l is used.
    -o    Output directory. Download files into a specific directory.
    -O    Output file. Specify a name for the downloaded file instead of using the original file's name.
          -O has no effect if several files will be downloaded.
    -p    Password. Provide a password for protected downloads.
    -q    Quiet mode. No output will be generated.
    -t    Test mode. Perform all operations EXCEPT file downloading.

``LINK`` can be the URL to a file you want to download
(i.e. http://host.com/myFile.zip) or the path to a file containing one
ore several URL(s).

**Examples:**

.. code:: bash

    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli http://host.com/myFile.zip
    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli -o Documents/ http://host.com/myFile.zip
    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli urls.txt
    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli -t links-to-test.txt
    mitch@raspberrypi ~ $ rdcli -l links.txt > unrestricted-links.txt

For development purposes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `RDWorker`_ file. It defines 4 classes:

-  ``RDError``: Base Exception to be inherited for all Exception related
   to Real-Debrid
-  ``UnrestrictionError``: Exception thrown when an error occurs during
   link unrestriction
-  ``LoginError``: Exception thrown when an error occurs on loging
-  ``RDWorker``: Worker class providing methods to

   -  login into Real-Debrid, establishing a cookie and keeping it until
      it’s expired
   -  unrestrict any supported link
